///
///   - If the values represent physical quantities, SI units should be used.
///
///   - If the values are of ratiometric nature, then float-typed values should be scaled as [-1,+1] or [0,+1].
///     Integer-typed values should be scaled according to their maximum representable values;
///     if symmetricity is desired, then the range should be [-max,+max] (e.g., [-127,+127] for int8).
///
/// If these types are used to control groups of nodes, then the controlled nodes are expected to
/// subscribe using the largest array types defined here.
/// Publishers would choose the array type depending on the number of nodes commanded at once.
/// The nodes would be expecting the largest array type, where the missing elements will be zero-filled
/// automatically by the protocol stack thanks to the Implicit Zero Extension Rule (refer to the Cyphal Specification).
