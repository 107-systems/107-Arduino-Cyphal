// | This implementation uses a minimal variant implementation that is forward-compatible with the same types generated
// | using the C++17 variant type in the standard library. This minimal variant implementation is limited in the
// | following ways:
// |    1. Supports only emplace and get_if.
// |    2. Only support access by index (see the IndexOf property of the VariantType).
// |    3. This object cannot be copy-constructed nor move-constructed.
// |    4. There is an O(n) lookup in this object's destructor and in the
// |       emplace method.
// |
// | The C++17 version of this object will define the same emplace and get_if wrappers so code written against this
// | version will be fully-forward compatible, but the C++17 version exposes the variant type directly allowing full
// | use of that standard library feature â€“ it is therefore not backwards-compatible.

/// Should it be necessary to control a group of servos in lockstep, an arbitrary number of them may subscribe
/// to the same setpoint subject (their published subjects would be different of course).
/// If the servo is ENGAGED, setpoint messages are processed as follows: the first field of the kinematic setpoint type
/// that contains a finite value is taken as the commanded setpoint. The following non-negative finite fields define
/// the motion profile, where negative and non-finite values are ignored.
/// For example, a translational dynamics message containing the following values:
///   position     = +0.35
///   velocity     = NaN
///   acceleration = NaN
///   force        = 30
/// ...is interpreted as follows: position the load at 0.35 meters relative to the neutral, limit the force to 30
/// newton,
/// do not limit the velocity and acceleration. Here is another example:
///   angular position     = NaN
///   angular velocity     = +400
///   angular acceleration = NaN
///   torque               = 50
/// which is interpreted as follows: reach the angular velocity of 400 radian/second in the forward direction,
/// limit the torque to 50 newton*meters, do not limit the acceleration.
/// The motion profile parameters that are not supported are to be silently ignored by the servo. If the commanded
/// parameter cannot be controlled by the servo, the setpoint is to be ignored. For example, in the second example
/// above,
/// if the servo does not support angular velocity control, the setpoint message would be discarded.
/// The above describes the typical use case where each servo is controlled over a dedicated setpoint
/// subject independently (or a group of servos are controlled in lockstep using the same setpoint subject).
/// Some applications may require synchronous independent control of multiple servos in a group, similar to ESC.
/// To address this, a compliant servo should support another operating mode where the controlled quantity
/// (position, velocity, force, etc.) is selected statically along with the motion profile (using the register API),
/// and the servo subscribes to the setpoint subject of type <types/reg.udral.service.actuator.common.sp.*".
/// Having its index in the group configured statically, the servo fetches the setpoint from the appropriate
/// index in the setpoint array.
/// The resulting topology closely resembles that of the ESC service:
