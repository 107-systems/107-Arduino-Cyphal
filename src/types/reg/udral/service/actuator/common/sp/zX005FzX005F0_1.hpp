// | This implementation uses a minimal variant implementation that is forward-compatible with the same types generated
// | using the C++17 variant type in the standard library. This minimal variant implementation is limited in the
// | following ways:
// |    1. Supports only emplace and get_if.
// |    2. Only support access by index (see the IndexOf property of the VariantType).
// |    3. This object cannot be copy-constructed nor move-constructed.
// |    4. There is an O(n) lookup in this object's destructor and in the
// |       emplace method.
// |
// | The C++17 version of this object will define the same emplace and get_if wrappers so code written against this
// | version will be fully-forward compatible, but the C++17 version exposes the variant type directly allowing full
// | use of that standard library feature â€“ it is therefore not backwards-compatible.

/// This is a collection of weakly-typed primitives used to control groups of actuators synchronously.
/// Actuators are expected to subscribe using the largest array type. Publishers would choose the array type
/// depending on the number of actuators in the group. The actuators would be expecting the largest array type,
/// where the missing elements will be zero-filled automatically by the protocol stack thanks to the
/// Implicit Zero Extension Rule (refer to the Cyphal Specification for details).
/// The physical meaning of the values contained in the array is defined by the respective actuator service
/// specification.
/// If ratiometric control is used, then the range should be [-1, +1].
/// It follows that a standalone actuator (that is not a member of any group) is just a special case of a group of 1,
/// where the setpoint type is a single scalar.
/// The Cyphal Specification might benefit from supporting flexible array fields to avoid having to deal with redundant
/// similar types: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member, so that instead of having multiple types that
/// differ only in size of the array fields, one could just say `float16[0] value` such that the size of zero indicates
/// that the array is a flex array.
