/// This is a collection of weakly-typed primitives used to control groups of actuators synchronously.
///
/// Actuators are expected to subscribe using the largest array type. Publishers would choose the array type
/// depending on the number of actuators in the group. The actuators would be expecting the largest array type,
/// where the missing elements will be zero-filled automatically by the protocol stack thanks to the
/// Implicit Zero Extension Rule (refer to the Cyphal Specification for details).
///
/// The physical meaning of the values contained in the array is defined by the respective actuator service
/// specification.
/// If ratiometric control is used, then the range should be [-1, +1].
///
/// It follows that a standalone actuator (that is not a member of any group) is just a special case of a group of 1,
/// where the setpoint type is a single scalar.
///
/// The Cyphal Specification might benefit from supporting flexible array fields to avoid having to deal with redundant
/// similar types: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member, so that instead of having multiple types that
/// differ only in size of the array fields, one could just say `float16[0] value` such that the size of zero indicates
/// that the array is a flex array.
