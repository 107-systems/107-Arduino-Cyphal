// | This implementation uses a minimal variant implementation that is forward-compatible with the same types generated
// | using the C++17 variant type in the standard library. This minimal variant implementation is limited in the
// | following ways:
// |    1. Supports only emplace and get_if.
// |    2. Only support access by index (see the IndexOf property of the VariantType).
// |    3. This object cannot be copy-constructed nor move-constructed.
// |    4. There is an O(n) lookup in this object's destructor and in the
// |       emplace method.
// |
// | The C++17 version of this object will define the same emplace and get_if wrappers so code written against this
// | version will be fully-forward compatible, but the C++17 version exposes the variant type directly allowing full
// | use of that standard library feature â€“ it is therefore not backwards-compatible.

/// This is the smart battery monitoring service. A smart battery is required to publish on the following subjects:
///   SUBJECT                         TYPE                                            TYP. RATE [Hz]
///   energy_source                   reg.udral.physics.electricity.SourceTs          1...100
///   status                          reg.udral.service.battery.Status                ~1
///   parameters                      reg.udral.service.battery.Parameters            ~0.2
/// Observe that only the first subject can be used for estimating the endurance of the power source. The other subjects
/// are designed for monitoring, diagnostics, and maintenance.
/// Optionally, the battery service can subscribe to a readiness control subject (see
/// reg.udral.service.common.Readiness),
/// which enables the following two optional capabilities:
///   - SLEEP mode: when the readiness subject commands the sleep state, the battery management system may enter a
///     low power consumption state, possibly deactivating some of its capabilities.
///   - STANDBY mode: the battery management system may implement additional safety protections that may otherwise
///     interfere with the normal operation of the vehicle. For example, the traction battery may limit the maximum
///     load current and the depth of discharge unless the commanded state is ENGAGED. By doing so, the battery can
///     protect itself and the supplied high-voltage DC network from accidental damage while the vehicle is parked.
///     Limiting the output power or discharge of the traction battery might lead to catastrophic consequences in
///     an aerial vehicle, hence such safety checks are to be disabled once the battery is commanded into the ENGAGED
///     state.
/// If readiness state selection is not supported, the battery may not subscribe to the readiness control subject,
/// in which case it should permanently report its state as ENGAGED unless the battery is unfit for use (e.g., due
/// to degradation or a failure).
/// By convention, positive current flows from the DC network into the battery. Therefore, the current is
/// negative when the battery powers the system, and positive when it is being charged.
/// Systems that leverage multiple battery packs simultaneously should be configured to publish the status of each
/// pack on a separate subject.
/// Published quantities should be low-pass filtered to avoid aliasing effects.
/// Publishers should strive to sample all parameters atomically.
/// The reported quantities are focused on the amount of energy that can be reclaimed from the battery. In a
/// simplified view, this can be seen as the amount of energy that is "stored" in the battery; however, this
/// interpretation is not strictly correct because the amount of retrievable energy may be dependent on external
/// factors such as the temperature of the battery or the load current. Energy estimation is hard and requires
/// accurate modeling of the state of the battery, which may be impossible to do without precise tracking of each
/// charging cycle. Despite the complications, this is considered to be a superior approach compared to the commonly
/// used alternative where the state estimation is focused on the electric charge, because the latter cannot be used
/// directly to predict the endurance of the system.
/// The methods of energy estimation are implementation-defined.
