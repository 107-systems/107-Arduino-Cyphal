// | This implementation uses a minimal variant implementation that is forward-compatible with the same types generated
// | using the C++17 variant type in the standard library. This minimal variant implementation is limited in the
// | following ways:
// |    1. Supports only emplace and get_if.
// |    2. Only support access by index (see the IndexOf property of the VariantType).
// |    3. This object cannot be copy-constructed nor move-constructed.
// |    4. There is an O(n) lookup in this object's destructor and in the
// |       emplace method.
// |
// | The C++17 version of this object will define the same emplace and get_if wrappers so code written against this
// | version will be fully-forward compatible, but the C++17 version exposes the variant type directly allowing full
// | use of that standard library feature â€“ it is therefore not backwards-compatible.

///
/// This message carries UDP packets from a node on the local bus to a remote host on the Internet or a LAN.
/// Any node can broadcast a message of this type.
/// All nodes that are capable of communication with the Internet or a LAN should subscribe to messages
/// of this type and forward the payload to the indicated host and port using exactly one UDP datagram
/// per message (i.e. additional fragmentation is to be avoided). Such nodes will be referred to as
/// "modem nodes".
/// It is expected that some systems will have more than one modem node available.
/// Each modem node is supposed to forward every message it sees, which will naturally create
/// some degree of modular redundancy and fault tolerance. The remote host should therefore be able to
/// properly handle possibly duplicated messages from different source addresses, in addition to
/// possible duplications introduced by the UDP/IP protocol itself. There are at least two obvious
/// strategies that can be employed by the remote host:
///   - Accept only the first message, ignore duplicates. This approach requires that the UDP stream
///     should contain some metadata necessary for the remote host to determine the source and ordering
///     of each received datum. This approach works best for periodic data, such as telemetry, where
///     the sender does not expect any responses.
///   - Process all messages, including duplicates. This approach assumes that the remote host acts
///     as a server, processing all received requests and providing responses to each. This arrangement
///     implies that the client may receive duplicated responses. It is therefore the client's
///     responsibility to resolve the possible ambiguity. An obvious solution is to accept the first
///     arrived response and ignore the later ones.
/// Applications are free to choose whatever redundancy management strategy works best for them.
/// If the source node expects that the remote host will send some data back, it shall explicitly notify
/// the modem nodes about this, so that they could prepare to perform reverse forwarding when the
/// expected data arrives from the remote host. The technique of reverse forwarding is known in
/// networking as IP Masquerading, or (in general) Network Address Translation (NAT). The notification
/// is performed by means of setting one of the corresponding flags defined below.
/// In order to be able to match datagrams received from remote hosts and the local nodes they should
/// be forwarded to, modem nodes are required to keep certain metadata about outgoing datagrams. Such
/// metadata is stored in a data structure referred to as "NAT table", where every entry would normally
/// contain at least the following fields:
///   - The local UDP port number that was used to send the outgoing datagram from.
///     Per RFC 4787, the port number is chosen by the modem node automatically.
///   - The node-ID of the local node that has sent the outgoing datagram.
///   - Value of the field session_id defined below.
///   - Possibly some other data, depending on the implementation.
/// The modem nodes are required to keep each NAT table entry for at least NAT_ENTRY_MIN_TTL seconds
/// since the last reverse forwarding action was performed. Should the memory resources of the modem node
/// be exhausted, it is allowed to remove old NAT entries earlier, following the policy of least recent use.
/// Having received a UDP packet from a remote host, the modem node would check the NAT table in order
/// to determine where on the Cyphal bus the received data should be forwarded to. If the NAT table
/// contains no matches, the received data should be silently dropped. If a match is found, the
/// modem node will forward the data to the recipient node using the service HandleIncomingPacket.
/// If the service invocation times out, the modem node is permitted to remove the corresponding entry from
/// the NAT table immediately (but it is not required). This will ensure that the modem nodes will not be
/// tasked with translations for client nodes that are no longer online or are unreachable.
/// Additionally, client nodes will be able to hint the modem nodes to remove translation entries they no
/// longer need by simply refusing to respond to the corresponding service invocation. Please refer to
/// the definition of that service data type for a more in-depth review of the reverse forwarding process.
/// Modem nodes can also perform traffic shaping, if needed, by means of delaying or dropping UDP
/// datagrams that exceed the quota.
/// To summarize, a typical data exchange occurrence should amount to the following actions:
///   - A local Cyphal node broadcasts a message of type OutgoingPacket with the payload it needs
///     to forward. If the node expects the remote host to send any data back, it sets the masquerading flag.
///   - Every modem node on the bus receives the message and performs the following actions:
///       - The domain name is resolved, unless the destination address provided in the message
///         is already an IP address, in which case this step should be skipped.
///       - The domain name to IP address mapping is added to the local DNS cache, although this
///         part is entirely implementation defined and is not required.
///       - The masquerading flag is checked. If it is set, a new entry is added to the NAT table.
///         If such entry already existed, its expiration timeout is reset. If no such entry existed
///         and a new one cannot be added because of memory limitations, the least recently used
///         (i.e. oldest) entry of the NAT table is replaced with the new one.
///       - The payload is forwarded to the determined IP address.
///   - At this point, direct forwarding is complete. Should any of the modem nodes receive an incoming
///     packet, they would attempt to perform a reverse forwarding according to the above provided algorithm.
/// It is recommended to use the lowest transport priority level when broadcasting messages of this type,
/// in order to avoid interference with a real-time traffic on the bus. Usage of higher priority levels is
/// unlikely to be practical because the latency and throughput limitations introduced by the on-board radio
/// communication equipment are likely to vastly exceed those of the local CAN bus.
