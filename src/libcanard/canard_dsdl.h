/// This is a DSDL serialization helper for libcanard -- a trivial optional extension library that contains basic
/// DSDL field serialization routines. It is intended for use in simple applications where auto-generated DSDL
/// serialization logic is not available. The functions are fully stateless and straightforward to use;
/// read their documentation comments for usage info.
///
/// This is an optional part of libcanard that can be omitted if this functionality is not required by the application.
/// Some high-integrity systems may prefer to avoid this extension because it relies on unsafe memory operations.
///
/// This library is designed to be compatible with any instruction set architecture (including big endian platforms)
/// but the floating point functionality will be automatically disabled at compile time if the target platform does not
/// use an IEEE 754-compatible floating point model. Support for other floating point models may be implemented later.
/// If your application requires non-IEEE-754 floats, please reach out to the maintainers via https://forum.uavcan.org.
///
/// To use the library, copy the files canard_dsdl.c and canard_dsdl.h into the source tree of the application.
/// No special compilation options are required. There are optional build configuration options defined near the top
/// of canard_dsdl.c; they may be used to fine-tune the library for the target platform (but it is not necessary).
